You can move your `Ubuntu` distribution from WSL 1 to WSL 2. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

### Steps to Convert Ubuntu from WSL 1 to WSL 2

1. **Ensure Hyper-V is Enabled:**
   - Since WSL 2 requires Hyper-V, make sure Hyper-V is enabled on your system. If it is not enabled, you can enable it through the Windows Features dialog (`optionalfeatures`).

2. **Update WSL Kernel:**
   - Ensure you have the latest WSL 2 Linux kernel update package. You can download and install it from [Microsoft's official site](https://aka.ms/wsl2kernel).

3. **Set WSL 2 as Default Version (Optional):**
   - If you want new distributions to default to WSL 2, you can set WSL 2 as the default version with:
     ```powershell
     wsl --set-default-version 2
     ```

4. **Convert Ubuntu to WSL 2:**
   - Use the following command to convert your `Ubuntu` distribution to WSL 2:
     ```powershell
     wsl --set-version Ubuntu 2
     ```
   - Replace `Ubuntu` with the exact name of your distribution if it's different.

5. **Verify the Conversion:**
   - After the conversion is complete, you can verify that `Ubuntu` is now using WSL 2 with:
     ```powershell
     wsl --list --verbose
     ```

### Troubleshooting

- **Check for Errors:** If you encounter any errors during the conversion, make sure that:
  - Hyper-V is enabled and running.
  - Your Windows build is up-to-date. WSL 2 requires Windows 10, version 1903, build 18362 or higher, or Windows 11.

- **Restart Required:** Sometimes, a restart of your computer may be required for changes to take effect.

By following these steps, you should be able to successfully move your `Ubuntu` distribution from WSL 1 to WSL 2. If you have any issues, let me know!
