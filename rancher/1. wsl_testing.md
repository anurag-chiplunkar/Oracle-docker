To check which virtualization is available on your Windows machine (Hyper-V or WSL) and determine the WSL version, you can follow these steps:

### Checking for Hyper-V

1. **Via Windows Features:**
   - Press `Win + R` to open the Run dialog.
   - Type `optionalfeatures` and press Enter.
   - In the Windows Features dialog, look for "Hyper-V" and check if it is enabled. If it's listed and checked, Hyper-V is available on your system.

2. **Via Command Prompt or PowerShell:**
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Run the following command:
     ```powershell
     systeminfo
     ```
   - Look for a section named "Hyper-V Requirements." If you see lines indicating that Hyper-V is supported (e.g., "VM Monitor Mode Extensions," "Virtualization Enabled In Firmware"), then Hyper-V is available.

### Checking for WSL Version

1. **Via Command Prompt or PowerShell:**
   - Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
   - Run the following command to check the installed WSL version:
     ```powershell
     wsl --list --verbose
     ```
   - This will list all installed WSL distributions and their version information. The version column indicates whether the distribution is using WSL 1 or WSL 2.

2. **Check WSL Version Installed:**
   - To check the version of WSL installed, use:
     ```powershell
     wsl --status
     ```
   - This command will provide details about the installed WSL version and configuration.

### Summary

- **Hyper-V Availability:** Check via Windows Features or `systeminfo` command.
- **WSL Version:** Use `wsl --list --verbose` to see the version for each installed distribution and `wsl --status` for general WSL version information.

If Hyper-V is enabled, you'll be able to use it for virtualization. If you're using WSL, knowing the version helps determine the features and compatibility of your Linux distributions.
