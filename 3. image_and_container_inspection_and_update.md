### 1. Checking if a Container is Running

#### Command: `docker ps`

**Purpose**:
- Lists all running containers.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker ps
```

**Explanation**:
- This command shows a list of containers that are currently running. It displays details like the container ID, image used, command, creation time, status, ports, and names.
- If you want to see all containers, including those that are stopped, you can use the `-a` option:

```bash
docker ps -a
```

**Output**:
- Example output:

```bash
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE         COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                    NAMES
f3b5d7b42d76   my-flask-app  "python app.py"          2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:5000->5000/tcp   my_container
```

### 2. Inspecting an Image

#### Command: `docker image inspect <image_name_or_id>`

**Purpose**:
- Provides detailed information about a Docker image, such as its layers, environment variables, configuration, etc.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker image inspect my-flask-app
```

**Explanation**:
- Replace `<image_name_or_id>` with the name or ID of the Docker image you want to inspect.
- This command gives you JSON output with all the metadata associated with the image, including its size, when it was created, the base layers, and configuration.

**Output**:
- Example snippet from the output (shortened for brevity):

```json
[
    {
        "Id": "sha256:abc123...",
        "RepoTags": ["my-flask-app:latest"],
        "Created": "2024-08-31T10:00:00.000000000Z",
        "Size": 215000000,
        "Config": {
            "Env": [
                "PATH=/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin"
            ],
            ...
        }
    }
]
```

### 3. Inspecting a Container

#### Command: `docker container inspect <container_name_or_id>`

**Purpose**:
- Provides detailed information about a Docker container, such as its configuration, network settings, volumes, environment variables, etc.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker container inspect my_container
```

**Explanation**:
- Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with the name or ID of the container you want to inspect.
- This command also returns JSON output with detailed metadata for the container, such as its state, IP address, mounted volumes, and more.

**Output**:
- Example snippet from the output (shortened for brevity):

```json
[
    {
        "Id": "f3b5d7b42d76...",
        "State": {
            "Status": "running",
            "Running": true,
            "Paused": false,
            "Restarting": false,
            ...
        },
        "NetworkSettings": {
            "IPAddress": "172.17.0.2",
            ...
        }
    }
]
```

### 4. Naming a Container

#### Command: `docker run --name <container_name> <image_name>`

**Purpose**:
- Assigns a specific name to a Docker container at the time of creation.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker run --name my_container my-flask-app
```

**Explanation**:
- Replace `<container_name>` with the desired name for the container.
- Replace `<image_name>` with the name of the image from which you want to create the container.
- Naming a container makes it easier to manage and reference it in future commands, rather than using the automatically generated names or container IDs.

**Example**:
```bash
docker run --name my_flask_container -p 5000:5000 my-flask-app
```
- This command runs a container named `my_flask_container` from the `my-flask-app` image.

### 5. Stopping/Killing a Container

#### Command: `docker stop <container_name_or_id>`

**Purpose**:
- Gracefully stops a running container by sending a `SIGTERM` signal, allowing it to shut down cleanly.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker stop my_container
```

**Explanation**:
- Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with the name or ID of the container you want to stop.
- This command waits for a default timeout (10 seconds) before forcefully killing the container if it doesnâ€™t stop on its own.

**Output**:
- The command will return the name or ID of the container that was stopped.

#### Command: `docker kill <container_name_or_id>`

**Purpose**:
- Immediately kills a running container by sending a `SIGKILL` signal, stopping it abruptly.

**Usage**:
```bash
docker kill my_container
```

**Explanation**:
- Replace `<container_name_or_id>` with the name or ID of the container you want to kill.
- Use this command when you need to immediately stop a container without waiting for it to gracefully shut down.

**Output**:
- The command will return the name or ID of the container that was killed.
